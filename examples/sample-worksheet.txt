Science Worksheet: Photosynthesis

1. What is photosynthesis?
Photosynthesis is the process by which plants convert sunlight, carbon dioxide, and water into glucose and oxygen. This process occurs in the chloroplasts of plant cells and is essential for life on Earth.

2. Write the chemical equation for photosynthesis.
6CO2 + 6H2O + light energy â†’ C6H12O6 + 6O2

3. What are the two main stages of photosynthesis?
The two main stages are the light-dependent reactions and the light-independent reactions (Calvin cycle). The light-dependent reactions occur in the thylakoids and convert light energy into chemical energy, while the Calvin cycle occurs in the stroma and uses this energy to produce glucose.

4. Why is photosynthesis important for life on Earth?
Photosynthesis is crucial because it produces oxygen that most living organisms need to breathe. It also removes carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, helping to regulate Earth's climate. Additionally, photosynthesis is the foundation of most food chains, as plants are primary producers.

5. What factors can affect the rate of photosynthesis?
Several factors can affect photosynthesis rate: light intensity (more light generally increases the rate up to a point), carbon dioxide concentration (higher CO2 levels can increase the rate), temperature (optimal temperature range exists), and water availability (water is a reactant in the process).

6. Explain the role of chlorophyll in photosynthesis.
Chlorophyll is the green pigment found in chloroplasts that captures light energy from the sun. It absorbs light primarily in the red and blue wavelengths and reflects green light, which is why plants appear green. The captured light energy is used to power the light-dependent reactions of photosynthesis.
